# WolfBeacon API Docs Generator

WolfBeacon has a bunch of services exposing different endpoints which make up the WolfBeacon API together.

This service attempts to accumlate API Documentation written in the form of [apidoc](http://apidocjs.com) strings across our microservices and serve them statically in one, well-formatted location.
