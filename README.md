# WolfBeacon API Docs Generator

WolfBeacon has a bunch of services exposing different endpoints which make up the WolfBeacon API together.

This service accumlates API Documentation written in the form of [apidoc](http://apidocjs.com) strings across WolfBeacon microservices and serves them statically via [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) in one, well-formatted location.
